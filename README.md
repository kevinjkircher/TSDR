This repository is a companion to the paper

    K.J. Kircher and K.M. Zhang. "Model Predictive Control of Thermal 
    Storage for Demand Response." In American Control Conference, 
    Proceedings of the 33rd (2015).

It simulates a variety of control strategies for cooling a commercial

Start with TSDR.m, a Matlab wrapper.

Add it and the folder 'Subfunctions' to your path.

Running the optimization routines requires the CVX toolbox, which is 
freely available at http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/.

Comments in the code should explain things from there.
